# ==============================================================================
# Mixers are organized hierarchically with the reltionships as follows:
# 
#	Mixer
#	|
#	|-> Trackgroup
#		| * At this level, Filters are stored.  Filters dictate what parts of
#		| 	the rig are effected by the Tracks that are children of the
#		|	trackgroup.
#		|
#		|-> Track
#			| * At this level, the Transition tracks are differentiated from
#			|	Layer tracks
#			| 		* Transition tracks have a global "weight" curve, while
#			|			layer tracks store weights per clip
#			| 		* Overlaps on Transition tracks need to be treated as
#			|			overlaps always
#			| 		* Overlaps between tracks need to be evaluated based on
#			|			track weight to determine overlap
#			| * Also at this level, Track "mute" or "solo" status is stored.
#			| 		* Soloing a track operates globally within the mixer
#			|			(across trackgroups)
#			| 		* Muted tracks can be ignored for our purposes.
#			|
#			|-> Clip
#				| * Weights are stored for clips on Layer tracks.
#				| * The in/out of clips is stored at this level
#				| * The Speed (scale) of clips is stored at this level
#				| * The start time within the shot is stored at this level
